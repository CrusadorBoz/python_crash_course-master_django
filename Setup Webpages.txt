Defining Models
Models tell django how to work with the data that will be stored in the app.
You can see the different type of fields at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/models/fields
After you update a model, you need to type python manage.py makemigrations <name of app>
    This will tell django to figure out how to modify the database
Then you type python manage.py migrate.  

admin.py:
We have to register our models into the admin.py.  

Making webpages in django consist of three states:
    1. defining URLs
    2. writing views
    3. writing templates

No order to actually complete, but good idea to start with URLs.
    *** For urls, remember the comma after the defining a path.  Easy to forget.
