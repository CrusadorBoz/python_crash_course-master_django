1. pip install --upgrade pip

2. pip install virtualenv
3. virtual venv  // install the venv in the folder of choice

Now you have to be in the virtual environment mode to install django
    * Change to the bin folder in venv.  

4. source activate  // you just type deactivate to stop the venv. 
********************************************
    *     * You will see (venv) gboz:bin/ $
********************************************
Change dir to the main folder /master

5. pip install django==4.1.*
    * pip list to check

While still in master you need to create the project.

********************  DO NOT FORGET THE DOT!!!!!  ***********************
6. django-admin startproject BOZ_Project .
    ** Very important to put in the dot.  It will create the folder
    ** the correct way to make it easier to deploy an app.

While still in the venv and /master, we need to create/link the database
    * You will see db.sqlite3
    * Anytime you modify the db you need to migrate

7. python manage.py migrate

*************************************************
***  Check-Check - python manage.py runserver ***
*************************************************

8. git init in the main folder

While in the venv and /master. (manage.py) we need to create the django app
    * You can have more than one app

python manage.py startapp master
    * I think it should be the same name as the folder

After you have setup your apps (putting it at the top) you need to migrate

9. python manage.py makemigrations master
    ** This tells django to figure out how to make the models work in the db

10. pyton manage.py migrate
    ** Now, we need to have the django setup the db.  

Everytime you change a model, you have to follow three steps to update the database
    * Modify models
    * call makemigrations master
    * migrate

11. python manage.py createsuperuser
    * Now we need to create a super user
